Thats repository with application looks like Windows Miner
========================
The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on a grid that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath. The location of the mines is discovered through a logical process (but that sometimes results in ambiguity). Clicking on the game board will reveal what is hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank squares [bordering 0 mines] may be revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other). Some squares are blank while others contain numbers (from 1 to 8), with each number being the number of mines adjacent to the uncovered square.

Description
===========


In my version there are 2 difficulty levels. Easy - field 10x10 and the number of bombs is 10. Hard - field 15x15 and the number of bombs is 20. To restart, you need to press the restart button. If you get on the cell with a bomb the game is lost and you need to press the restart button. If you win, you can click on the dialog window with a message about victory and the game will restart, also you can click restart, after close dialog window.
